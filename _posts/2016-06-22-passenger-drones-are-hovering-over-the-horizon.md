  FLYING a helicopter is tricky, especially when hovering. You use your left
  hand to raise and lower the collective-pitch lever (to climb or descend), your
  right hand to move the cyclic-pitch joystick (to go forwards, backwards and
  sideways) and both feet to work the anti-torque pedals (to point the nose).
